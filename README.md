(STILL ON WIP, Padding and Texture problems At this moment.)

During the month of October, 2024, Youtube has updated a few small things in the UI, this includes the Progress Bar going from a reddish hue, to a reddish and pink hue at the end. This has caused Nyan Cat's Progress Bar to completely die, this repo is to try and revive said Progress Bar. At the moment it is still written in Manifest V2 so it is not recommended to use it on Google Chrome which has updated to Manifest V3.

This is how looks like the original extension for the moment:
